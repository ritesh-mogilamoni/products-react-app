# Products React App 🛍️

A modern and responsive **Products Application** built using **React + Vite**.
This project fetches products from an external API and displays them in a clean UI with product search and product detail navigation functionality.

The application demonstrates core React concepts such as routing, API fetching, navigation, state management, conditional rendering, and reusable components.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project was created to practice:

* React Router
* API Integration
* Dynamic Routing
* Navigation using `useNavigate`
* State Management using `useState`
* Side Effects using `useEffect`
* Search Functionality
* Conditional Rendering
* Component Reusability
* Tailwind CSS Styling

The app displays products fetched from the Fake Store API and allows users to navigate to individual product pages.

# 🔹 React Concepts

## Functional Components

Created reusable components such as:

* `Header`
* `Footer`
* `Home`
* `Product`
* `ProductsList`
* `RootLayout`

---

## useState Hook

Used `useState` for:

* Products data
* Loading state
* Error handling
* Search input

Example:

```js id="lg5ix8"
const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
```

---

## useEffect Hook

Used `useEffect` to fetch API data when the component loads.

Example:

```js id="u6bdfu"
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products")
}, []);
```

---

## React Router

Implemented routing using:

* `NavLink`
* `Outlet`
* `useNavigate`
* `useLocation`

### Learned:

* Nested routing
* Route navigation
* Passing state between routes
* Layout-based routing

---

## Navigation using useNavigate

Navigated dynamically to product detail pages.

Example:

```js id="jlwmnh"
navigate("/product", { state: { product: productObj } });
```

---

## useLocation

Accessed passed product data in the Product page.

Example:

```js id="2yxkqs"
const { state } = useLocation()
```

---

## API Fetching

Fetched data using `fetch()` API.

Example:

```js id="ay9cje"
fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products")
```

---

## Conditional Rendering

Handled:

* Loading states
* Error messages

Example:

```js id="k3i4mo"
if (loading) {
  return <p>Loading...</p>
}
```

---

## Filtering Data

Implemented product search using `.filter()`.

Example:

```js id="4g6bg8"
const filteredProducts = products.filter((product) =>
  product.category.includes(search)
)
```

---

## Dynamic Rendering using map()

Displayed products dynamically.

Example:

```js id="js2q3r"
filteredProducts.map((product) => (
  <div key={product.id}></div>
))
```
